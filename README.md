The data collection loop has been commented out in the code file as rerunning it is unnecessary with the data files saved.

The files were collected from Apr 2nd through April 5th:
- user_data_1.txt (mastodon.social)
- user_data_2.txt (mstdn.social)
- user_data_3.txt (mas.to)
- user_data_4.txt (techhub.social)
